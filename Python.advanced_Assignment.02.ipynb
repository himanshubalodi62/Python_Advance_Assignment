    "#### Q1. What is the relationship between classes and modules?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "i. Class is the collection of methods, constructor and variables, and to define a class we use class keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. Module is a collection of classes, functions, and attributes, which is like a package.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. We can modify the attributes of the class by using inheritance. But we can simply use the codes written in a module by importing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Python** class is like an outline/blueprint/mold for creating a new object. An object is anything that you wish to manipulate or change while working through the code. Every time a class object is instantiated, which is when we declare a variable, a new object is initiated from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas in Python, **Modules** are simply files with the **. py** extension containing Python code that can be imported inside another Python Program. In simple terms, we can consider a module to be the same as a code library or a file that contains a set of functions/Classes that you want to include in your application.\n",
